# studentsbooks

This project was made by me to understand and comprehend the capabilities of the Spring Framework, and so many of its features. This application has a librarian login in which he can
issue books to the students. This application is intended to be very simple.

It will have a librarian logging in, with session validations.
He will be able to add books to the student, with per student getting max of 2 books
He will be able to remove books from the student account.
He is able to add student to the DB.
We are not giving roles to the users according to their levels and permissions(atleast as of now).


As of now, All the Repository beans and service beans are getting created properly!
